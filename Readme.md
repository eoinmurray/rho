# Rho


Rho (needs name change) aims to be like git but for simulations. It will take a snapshot of the input and output 
of a given simulation run and save it in a well organised repository.

    Usage: rho [options] [command]
  
    Commands:
  
      init                   initialize a new photon repo.
      commit <commit_message> commit some state.
      list                   list commits.
      setstate <id>          set the state from a commit.
  
    Options:
  
      -h, --help     output usage information
      -V, --version  output the version number
      -f, --force    force a command

There are a lot of support services that Ill come up with and eventually add, like a built in server to allow 
a stylish was to browse simulation runs.

## Todo

Everything.
